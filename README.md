		Requirements

	Add new members
There should be 3 options when adding a members
Default member(which is super class)- encapsulation and inheritance- the MembershipNumber, the Name and the StartMembershipDate.
StudentMember(sub class)- encapsulation and inheritance- the MembershipNumber, the Name and the StartMembershipDate.
•	The StudentMember class should include specific information about the SchoolName and the relative get/set methods

Over60members (sub class)- encapsulation and inheritance- the MembershipNumber, the Name and the StartMembershipDate.
•	The Over60Member class should include specific information about the Age and the relative get/set methods

You should implement a class Date to represent the starting membership date (which is the instance variable in the DefaultMember class). Do not use any predefined library for date and time and you can refer as example to the class that has been provided during the tutorials
<hr>

	Delete members

given the membership number, and display the number of free spaces left in the system. Display the type of the member that has been deleted (if it is a default, student or over60member)
<hr>

	Print the members information

in the system. For each member, print the membership number, the type of member (if is a default, student or over60 member), the member starting date and the member name.
<hr>

	Sort the items

in ascending order according to the name.<hr>

<hr>

	Write/save in a file

The manager can visualise the list of members through a table with relative information.
The user can search the members according at least one parameter (e.g. membership
number, or the name, etc.)
